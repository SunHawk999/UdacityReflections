When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping 
all work local?
  	-When backups need to be created, or when multiple people 
	want to work on something.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote 
repository? 
	-If updates were automatic, then changes might cause errors
	in remote code. So for the sake of more control, pull 
	changes are done manually. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When 
would you use one instead of the other.
	-Forks are clones of a repository on Github itself. Clones
	are a copy of a repository on a local machine. Branches are
	separate commits, somewhat separate clones of a single 
	repository. Forks would be used when you want to work on a 
	repository on Github without actually changing it. Clones
	are used for working on an online repository on a local
	machine. Branches are used when specific kind of code is
	being used, or for keeping a working part of the repository.
