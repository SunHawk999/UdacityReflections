What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need it?
	-When a repository is initialized, git metadata is created
	that keeps track of changes done to a repository. This is
	needed so that the changes can be kept track of.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
	-The staging area is different in that individual files are
	added so that they are the ones to be committed to the
	repository. The value that it offers is that specific files
	can be chosen to committed.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	-The staging area can be used concurrently with git diff
	to track changes to specified files.
