What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need it?
	-When a repository is initialized, git metadata is created
	that keeps track of changes done to a repository. This is
	needed so that the changes can be kept track of.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
	-The staging area is different in that individual files are
	added so that they are the ones to be committed to the
	repository. The value that it offers is that specific files
	can be chosen to committed.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	-The staging area can be used concurrently with git diff
	to track changes to specified files.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping
your history organized? How would branches help?
	-Say if there are multiple bugs to fix, or different changes
	that would need to be made at specific times, then branching
	would be helpful. Branches would help by being able to focus
	on particular parts of code or files.
